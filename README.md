# Retail_Location

Company A is interested in building geofences around its retail locations and using 3rd party mobile data to dress a better profile of their consumers, helping plan future marketing campaigns. Before manually mapping geofences of thousands of retail locations, the leadership team turns towards you, the data scientist, to create/find at least 1000 geofences in QC to test the 3rd party data.

Provide a list of at least 1000 retail locations and their geofences in QC
Display them on a map
Discuss pros/cons of your approach
Plot the distribution of their sales
Discuss the distribution of their sales (normality, outliers, variance, standard deviation, etc.)
To achieve this, you can use the technologies and tools of your choice.
