# Retail_Location

Company A is interested in building geofences around its retail locations and using 3rd party mobile data to dress a better profile of their consumers, helping plan future marketing campaigns.
Before manually mapping geofences of thousands of retail locations, the leadership team turns towards you, the data scientist, to create/find at least 1000 geofences in QC to test the 3rd party data.
<ol>
    <li> Provide a list of at least 1000 retail locations and their geofences in QC </li>
    <li> Display them on a map </li>
    <li>  Discuss pros/cons of your approach </li>
    <li>  Plot the distribution of their sales </li>
    <li> Discuss the distribution of their sales (normality, outliers, variance, standard deviation, etc.) </li>
</ol>
To achieve this, you can use the technologies and tools of your choice.
